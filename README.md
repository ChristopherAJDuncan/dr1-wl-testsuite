# dr1-wl-testsuite
A repo for the collection of routines to carry out tests on the shear catalogues for DR1. Contains both WL1 and WL2 contributions.

# Usage

Place any routines necessary to produce plots in the `modules` directories: this can include anything that returns a figure / axes, as well as modules which produce necessary data for plots. Place scripts to output plots in the `plotters` directory. If possible, please try to use a naming convention that ties to specific tests, as detailed in the WL-1 and WL-2 test document.
