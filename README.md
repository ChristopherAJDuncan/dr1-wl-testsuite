# dr1-wl-testsuite
A repo for the collection of routines to carry out tests on the shear catalogues for DR1. Contains both WL1 and WL2 contributions.

# Usage

Place any routines necessary to produce plots (that don't actually produce them) in the `modules` directories. Place scripts and routines to produce plots in the `plotters` directory. If possible, please try to use a naming convention that ties to specific tests, as detailed in the WL-1 and WL-2 test document.
